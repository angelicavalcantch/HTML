    <p>After all the battles we fought together, after all the difficult times we saw together, and after all the good and bad moments we’ve been through, I think it’s time I let you know how I feel about you.</p>
    
    <h2>You are the light of my life</h2>

    <p>You complete my darkness with your light. I love:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>the way you see good in the worst things</li>
        <li>the way you handle emotionally difficult situations</li>
        <li>the way you look at Justice</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I have learned a lot from you. You have occupied a special place in my heart over time.</p>

    <p>I have a confession to make</p>

    <p>It feels like my chest <em>does</em> have a heart. You make my heart beat. Your smile brings a smile to my face, your pain brings pain to my heart.</p>

    <p>I don’t show my emotions, but I think this man behind the mask is falling for you.”</p>

    <p><strong>I love you Superman.</strong></p>

    <p>Your not-so-secret-lover, <br>
        Batman</p>
